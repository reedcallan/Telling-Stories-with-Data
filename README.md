# Reed Callan's Portfolio
## Introduction
This is my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data.
Data visualization is going to be an incredibly instrumental element of the work I plan on doing. Whether it be policy analysis, policy research, or data science, visualization is an important tool that can help provide context and understanding in a condensed format. I look forward to building a better foundation of these skills and practicing them throughout the course.
## What I Hope to Learn
* Color Schemes and how to use color
* What to look for when critiquing existing visualizations
* How to create meaningful visualizations based off data sets
* How to structure my visualizations to ensure that I displaying data in a way that communicates my point
