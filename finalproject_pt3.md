# Final Project Part III

### [Final Deliverable](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/swipe-based-dating-applications-callan/index.html)

## What I Made
I made my final deliverable in shorthand as I planned with my original topic. The flexibility and versatility of the platform allowed me to craft a new story for Swipe-Based Dating Applications. In my story, I wanted to make sure that the graphics were adding value and I believe I found a solid story where they could help outline.

My audeince was similar to what I imagined (individuals in their 20s that use these applications), but I widened the scope so I could provide information to all parties. Overall, my story was attempting to bring unpleasant news to users of these applications, but ultimately understand that there are other options to dating. I believe I acheived this through my somewhat unpleasant and lonely images in the conflict section and the more joyous images in the solutions section.


## What I Changed
There were a lot of worries going into part 3. Switching the topic last minute created many issues including a missed opportunity to focus on what story I was trying to tell. Chanaradee and Chris both gave great feedback on the importance of focusing my story. To focus my story, I eliminated the mentions of COVID-19 and its effects as it created another narative that could be explored. I also wanted to make sure I was bridging the gap between mental health and eating/body disorders.

Additionally, it was vital to take the critiques from the interviews I conducted. Some key changes I made from these critiques involved givng more context as to what Swipe-Based Dating Applications are and what they provide for modern dating. There were also critiques on the graphs to add more labels to explain them more clearly.
