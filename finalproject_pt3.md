# Final Project Part III
## What I Changed
There were a lot of worries going into part 3. Switching the topic last minute created many issues including a missed opportunity to focus on what story I was trying to tell. Chanaradee and Chris both gave great feedback on the importance of focusing my story. To focus my story, I eliminated the mentions of COVID-19 and its effects as it created another narative that could be explored.
