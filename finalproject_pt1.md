# **Fracking on the Marcellus Shale:**
# The Destruction of American Communities
## Outline
Goal of this topic is to not only inform the public of the dangers and hazards produced by fracking, but to also give power to said public to act against shale gas companies. The audience will primarily be those individuals who have been propositioned to lease their land to shale companies. However, I believe that this information should be provided to the public in the pursuit of awareness of the harm that fracking can bring.
