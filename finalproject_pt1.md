# **Fracking on the Marcellus Shale:** The Destruction of American Communities
## Outline
Goal of this topic is to not only inform the public of the dangers and hazards produced by fracking, but to also give power to said public to act against shale gas companies. The audience will primarily be those individuals who have been propositioned to lease their land to shale companies. However, I believe that this information should be provided to the public in the pursuit of awareness of the harm that fracking can bring.

1. **Introduction to Fracking**
- How does fracking work?
- Benefits
2. **Environmental Damage**
3. **Community Damage**
- Example: Flint, Michigan
4. **What can you do if propositioned?**
- Companies that target
- Groups that provide aid
5. **How to help members in my community?**
- Reaching out to canvasing organizations
- Create your own group within your community

## Method, Medium, and Sketching
To accomplish the feeling of dread and eventual hope, I wanted to structure the website around the fracking process.

Ideally, the website would start above the surface. Give the essentials of fracking process and exactly what happens while explaining in layman terms. Next, we move down the pipe to the environmental harm and communal harm done by fracking. By the time we have made it to the most hopeless part of the website we start to make our way back up the pipe. As the

## Data
Many studies have evaluated the detrimental harm that fracking brings, so it was not very difficult to collect said data. Although, I wanted to make sure I am using the data efficiently, so I plan to include striking graphics that summarize 1) water quality impact and 2) air quality impact.

While many individuals care for the enviroment the topic has become so polarizing that I wanted to make sure I could cut through to them. For that reason, I researched communal harm.
