## Self-Reflection
When I look at the first two visualizations, I can definitely see pros and cons of both options. The first option provides a good visualization of how countries compare to each other, but this option only focuses on one year and does not pay attention to the flow of time. The second option is a good way to look at the flow of time for every country, but this option does not give the viewer a focus on a particular data set. Looking at the second option just creates confusion as to what point the chart-maker wants to get across to the viewer.

For the third option, I wanted to incorporate the best aspects of each option while maintaining the points I believe were supposed to be highlighted. So, I created a line graph, but focused on the top 4 countries in 2020. I found that creating this option allows the viewer to focus on a more condensed time period (the progress after the last recession), but also identify the difference between the 4 countries. Itay and USA have a very similar path so I de-emphasized them. Greece started out similar to USA and Italy but has seen a significant increase in the past 10 years. Finally, Japan has always been high, and has continued to increase in recent years. I also wanted to make sure to include the average debt-to-gdp ratio for reference. While I did not include all countries, I believe that I was able to tell a significant story here.
