# Final Project Part II #

Explanation for Topic switch
While I was going to tell my story on fracking in the Appalachin Basin, I ultimately decided against it. There were very few publically available data sets, and the ones that were available had extremely scientific terminology. If I were to tell this story, I would need a lot more time to understand the data and the story it tells.

When pivoting, I knew I wanted a topic with less jargon and more clear evidence towards the story I had in mind. Finally, I wanted a topic that I had personal experience with. After considering these factors, I decided to focus on Swipe-Based Dating Apps and their Impact on our Health.

## Setup ##
When introducing the topic I want to make sure I clarify that I am focusing on Swipe-Based Dating apps (e.g. Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Grindr, etc.). 

After clarifying, I will then proceed to talk about some advantages to online dating like exposure, safety, and vetting your dates. I’ll, then, discuss the growing popularity of dating apps as well as the influx of users due to COVID-19 and the quarantine. I will use Visualization #1 to focus on the general growth over the years and after my transition to COVID I will use the statistic that states “53% of dating app users reported somewhat more or much more usage during 2020”

This first visualization will show the enormous popularity of the dating apps in the last 6 years and the prevalence of them in our culture. Furthermore, the COVID statistic demonstrates the increased activity that came as a result of the pandemic and quarantine.
