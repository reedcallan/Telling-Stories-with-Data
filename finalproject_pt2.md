# Final Project Part II #

## Topic Switch ##
While I was going to tell my story on fracking in the Appalachin Basin, I ultimately decided against it. There were very few publically available data sets, and the ones that were available had extremely scientific terminology. If I were to tell this story, I would need a lot more time to understand the data and the story it tells.

When pivoting, I knew I wanted a topic with less jargon and more clear evidence towards the story I had in mind. Finally, I wanted a topic that I had personal experience with. After considering these factors, I decided to focus on Swipe-Based Dating Apps and their Impact on our Health.

## Setup ##
When introducing the topic I want to make sure I clarify that I am focusing on Swipe-Based Dating apps (e.g. Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Grindr, etc.). 

After clarifying, I will then proceed to talk about some advantages to online dating like exposure, safety, and vetting your dates. I’ll, then, discuss the growing popularity of dating apps as well as the influx of users due to COVID-19 and the quarantine. I will use Visualization #1 to focus on the general growth over the years and after my transition to COVID I will use the statistic that states “53% of dating app users reported somewhat more or much more usage during 2020”


Visualization #1
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11386604"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
This first visualization will show the enormous popularity of the dating apps in the last 6 years and the prevalence of them in our culture. Furthermore, the COVID statistic demonstrates the increased activity that came as a result of the pandemic and quarantine.

## Conflict ##
Following the setup, I want to utilize the data I have on reasons being go on dating apps vs. the results they see. This data will allow me to paint the picture that many have high hopes for long lasting relationships being formed on these apps but very few see results.


Visualization #2
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/11384044"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
</div>


Visualization #3
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/11384439"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This point of few results from a good deal of effort leads to the cycle of dating apps graphic I will include.

This chart should hammer home that there is a consistent cycle that can lead to mental harm which I will prove by displaying the following visualization.


Visualization #4
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-radar" data-src="visualisation/11384695"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
That will hopefully confirm their suspicions. However, we aren’t done yet. I would then provide data on the physical harm that dating apps could do to its users.


Visualization #5
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-radar" data-src="visualisation/11384801"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
At this point, the user is at their lowest, and this is where I want to include some resolution.
## Resolution ##
The resolution will be significantly less bleak and focus on ways to avoid dating app fatigue. Methods will include screen time adjustments, muting notifications from dating apps, as well as trying dating in-person through social events like speed dating. The overall goal here is to provide the average dating app user with knowledge of the potential harms while maintaining hope towards finding that special someone.
## User Research Protocol ##
### Target Audience ###

The target audience here is going to be people dating their 20s. This is a very wide reaching base, but I particularly want to focus on those who are going through the situation demonstrated in my cycle design above

### Identifying Approach to Interviewees ###
I wanted to get voices from different stages in relationships. I wanted to also get perspective from someone who had no experience in online dating to see a different perspective.

### Interview Script ###
1. Who do you think this is trying to reach?
2. Pick your least favorite visualization. What would you change about it?
3. What did you learn?
4. Did this story flow for you?

### Overall Findings ###
**Married, 64 years old:**
Please make sure that you are explaining the difference between swipe-based online dating and normal online dating. I liked all the visualizations but maybe add subtitles so we have more context. I think it flowed well! I didn’t know that this was such a big issue in modern dating.

**In a Couple, 27 years old:**
Could have applied to me a year ago. I didn’t like the first bar chart. Why are you highlighting “Relieving Boredom”. I didn’t really learn anything, but that is mainly because I’ve been through this and know that dating apps suck.

**Single, 25 years old:**
I love this and the color it reminds me too much of Tinder. I’m a little confused by the Physical health graph. I understand why it is here, but it needs to be explained further. I honestly feel so much better, as I was just trying to find a way to describe the frustration I get from dating apps. This helped me put words to my emotions.

### Plans ### 
I feel like the biggest aspect I need to work on is my story flow. I have decent visualizations (maybe a few tweaks), but the overall story flow needs to be clearer. I saw a great deal of confusion when assessing the physical health visualization, so I could benefit from an evaluation there. Finally, I need more concrete resources at the end to define a call-to-action.
